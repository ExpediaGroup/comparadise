# Why Comparadise?

So we want to introduce visual regression testing into our project, but which tool is best for the job?

Some visual testing tools require us to commit base images to your repository. These images both create bloat and
create a tedious review process in the CI. With this workflow, you must take extra steps to download the generated diffs,
compare them on your local file system, and commit the new images manually after review.

Comparadise offers a seamless experience that allows us to easily review visual changes
right from pull requests, and it also provides tools to make visual test setup simple.
