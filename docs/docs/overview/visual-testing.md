# Visual Testing

When developing a web application, it is important to ensure that there are no broken experiences that make it to end users.
However, when iterating quickly, the best way to ensure quality is through automated tests that run before each and every
change goes out.

Visual regression testing allows us to automatically determine when changes cause visual differences,
and they force us to review these changes to check if they are acceptable.

Some visual changes are acceptable, if they are intended as a result of a deliberate change to the UI. However,
other visual changes are unexpected and could cause degradation for users.

Either way, the prospect of preventing visual bugs is enough for visual tests to be worth having in our projects!
