# Deploying the Web App

Comparadise ships a web application that can be deployed using Docker.
This app provides the experience where visual changes are reviewed.

An example Dockerfile might look something like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM expediagroup/comparadise:latest
```

You can deploy this any way you would like!
