# Setting Up Cloud Storage

Make sure you create an S3 bucket using AWS. This is where Comparadise will read from (and write to) when your tests run
and when you use the Comparadise app to review changes.

Follow the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) to create a new S3 bucket.
