# Creating Base Images

Once your infrastructure is in place and you have written your first visual test, it's time to create base images!

Run your visual tests on a new pull request, and upon completion there will be a Comparadise comment. Clicking the link
will take you to the Comparadise app, where will see only the "new" images. Simply click "update base images" to set these
as your new base images. The next time these visual tests run and there is a visual change, you will be able to compare
the new images to the base images and determine whether a visual regression occurred!
